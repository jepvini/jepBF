### BF converter and interpreter written in C
*by jep*

The `convert.c` script will convert any ascii compliant text file to the brainfuck code that generate it\
A `-O` flag can be added to encrease the `BF_FACTTOR` of the output file\

The `interpret.c` file should (hopefully) revert the text back to normal\

# TODO:
the `-O3` is not yet done
